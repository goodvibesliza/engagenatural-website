## Phase 9 ‚Äî Sampling Program / Coupon System

**Objective:**  
Enable brands to run staff sampling campaigns and coupon reimbursements using verified CSV exports from EngageNatural ‚Äî no clearinghouse dependency for MVP.

**Current State:**  
- Verified employee + training linkage in Firestore  
- CSV export tool functional in Brand Dashboard  
- Basic ROI math and KPI cards live in-app  
- Awaiting automation of reward notifications via Telegram  
- Firestore data model includes: `coupon_redemptions`, `training_linked_skus`, `sampling_requests`

**Next Steps:**  
- [ ] Generate brand-facing CSV export for sampling/coupon redemption (fields: store, staff_id, sku, date, verified_photo_url)  
- [ ] Automate Telegram alerts to brands when new CSVs or campaign results are available  
- [ ] Add fraud prevention (photo + GPS validation)  
- [ ] Implement ROI dashboard for brands (aggregated by SKU/store)  
- [ ] QA CSV output and test import into partner clearinghouse later (TLC/Inmar optional integration)

**Notifications:**  
Sampling events (request create/approve/deny/ship) now route through the new Telegram system ‚Äî replacing legacy email/push. See `/docs/Notification-System.md` for function paths and env setup.

---

## Phase 10 ‚Äî Notifications (Telegram MVP)

**Objective:**  
Replace Email + Push notifications with Telegram-based communication through @EngageNaturalBot.  
Supports both transactional (quiz pass, reward sent) and broadcast (new brand, new challenge) messaging.

**Current State:**  
- Bot live and linked in Profile via deep link (`t.me/EngageNaturalBot?start=link_<uid>`)  
- Firestore integration for chat_id and message logs completed  
- Functions for outbound message queue in progress  

**Next Steps:**  
- [ ] Refactor existing notification helpers to route via Telegram (`sendTelegram()`)  
- [ ] Connect lesson pass and sampling reward triggers  
- [ ] Add channel-based broadcasts for new brands, lessons, and challenges  
- [ ] Verify rate limits, retry logic, and logging to `notifications_meta`  

**Reference:** `/docs/Notification-System.md`

## Phase 11 ‚Äî Brands Landing & Marketing Site

**Current internal page:**  
- Basic version of BrandsLanding.jsx exists under the main web app (src/components/BrandsLanding.jsx).  
- Shows ROI, engagement, and sales impact charts using static PNGs.  
- Formspree contact form functioning.  

**Next Step:**  
Migrate this content into a standalone **Next.js marketing site** at **brands.engagenatural.com**.

**Marketing site tasks:**

- [x]  Create new repo: engagenatural-brands-site  
- [x]  Implement pages from /docs/operations/brands-marketing-site.md  
- [x]  Set up Netlify site + DNS (CNAME/ALIAS) ‚Üí brands.engagenatural.com
