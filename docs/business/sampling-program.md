# Sampling Program

Overview of brand product sampling workflows integrated with communities and trainings.

## Goals

- Attribute engagement to sampling cohorts.

## Data Model

- Sampling requests under brand-specific collections or a shared `sample_requests` collection.
- Link to trainingId and communityId for attribution.

## Workflow

1) Staff requests sample via community post or brand page.
2) Brand approves and ships; status updates visible to staff.
3) Analytics attribute training completion to sampling.
