# EngageNatural Sampling Program Plan

Updated – October 2025

## 1. Overview
EngageNatural connects verified retail staff with the brands they represent in store. Staff claim a free product directly from the shelf using a digital manufacturer coupon after completing a short training. No shipping. No lost sample boxes. Real POS data.

## 2. Core Objectives
- Replace physical sample programs with verifiable, shelf-based trials.
- Drive measurable sell-through on trained SKUs.
- Tie training to coupon redemptions and store movement data.
- Reward staff for learning and give brands clean ROI.

## 3. How It Works
Verify employee status with GPS at the store. Train on the product in the app. Reward with a single-use free product coupon. Redeem at checkout like any manufacturer coupon. Track results in dashboards and SPINS/IRI overlays.

## 4. Brand Workflow
- Create a training campaign and pick SKUs already on shelf.
- Fund coupon redemptions at about $3 per redeemed coupon all-in.
- Monitor completions, redemptions, stores, dates, and “reorder nudges” from staff.
- Reimbursement is automatic through the coupon processor.

## 5. Pricing Model
- Coupon processor fee: ~$0.05–$0.15 per redemption
- EngageNatural platform fee: ~$2.85 per redemption
- Total to brand: ~$3.00 per redeemed coupon

## 6. Data & ROI
- POS redemption data: UPC, store, date, price
- SPINS/IRI movement lift on trained SKUs
- “Reorder nudge” events from staff after trial
- Cost-per-trial and campaign ROI

## 7. Retailer Benefits
- Automatic reimbursement through established clearinghouses
- Better-trained staff recommending items that are actually on shelf
- No logistics or backroom handling

## 8. Anti-Fraud
- Verified employees only, with store GPS match
- Single-use coupon IDs with 14-day expiration
- Device validation and signed coupon payloads
- Optional re-verification photo on risk signals

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Full clearinghouse API integration at scale
- SPINS overlays in brand dashboards
- Influencer Trial & Education Verification coming soon

## 10. New-Store Placement: Instant Training + Trial
When a brand wins new placement at a store, they can immediately activate EngageNatural:

- Simple link for the store: “Your staff can get trained now and try one free today.” The coupon takes one unit off the shelf when redeemed, so the buyer should reorder soon.
- Sell-in talk track for brands: “Along with our new placement, your staff can complete a two-minute training and receive a one-time free product coupon. It rings at the register like any manufacturer coupon, and you are reimbursed through the clearinghouse. This drives first-hand trial and faster recommendations on the floor.”

This turns a sell-in conversation into an immediate sell-through plan.

## 11. Manager Fast-Track: Store-Specific Verification Code
Brands can create a store-specific verification code for the manager to onboard the whole team quickly.

How it works:
- Brand generates a unique code in the brand dashboard for Store X.
- Code is capped to the number of employees the brand authorizes, for example 8 redemptions.
- The manager shares the code with staff by email or breakroom poster.
- Each employee enters the code, takes the in-app photo, and is verified with photo + store GPS.
- As staff complete training, they receive their free product coupon.

Safety and controls:
- Code auto-expires on a set date or when the max user count is reached.
- Verification still requires an in-session photo and store location match.
- Brand dashboard shows how many verifications used the code and who redeemed.

## 12. If Trained Product Isn’t on Shelf
After training, if the SKU is missing or low:
- The app prompts the employee to tell the ordering manager they completed training and would like to try or restock the item.
- Staff can log a quick “reorder nudge” with one tap.
- Brands see aggregate nudges per store to support follow-ups.

## 13. Influencer Trial & Education Verification (Coming Soon)
- Verify influencers are real people with linked social and identity.
- Require brand training before content goes live.
- Issue influencer-coded coupons for audience trial and measurable conversion.
- Protect brand messaging while proving impact.

## 14. Costs, Setup, and Time
- Initial setup with clearinghouse: ~$2,000–$5,000 one-time for onboarding and barcode ranges.
- Per-coupon cost: ~$0.10 processor fee included in the ~$3.00 brand rate.
- Integration timeline: 2–4 weeks to connect APIs and QA.
- Ongoing effort: light. Create campaigns, set budgets, review automated reports.

AI assistance:
- Auto-fill coupon metadata and expirations by SKU
- Monitor anomalies and alert on fraud patterns
- Forecast redemption volume against budget
- Draft training blurbs, coupon terms, and sell-in emails

## 15. Strategic Summary
Train. Try. Track. EngageNatural replaces wasteful sample boxes with POS-verified staff trial and real sell-through. Brands get proof that education drives sales, stores are reimbursed automatically, and staff get meaningful rewards that turn into better recommendations.

Key additions in this update:
- New-store placement link that triggers immediate staff training and a free coupon
- Store-specific manager verification codes capped by headcount
- Clear reorder prompt after redemptions
- Influencer verification and special coupons on the roadmap
