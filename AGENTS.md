# AGENTS

This repository uses agent-style automation for CI/Dev tasks.
For now, this is a placeholder to satisfy toolchain checks.

## Defined Agents (placeholder)
- **build-agent**: runs install/build/test across workspaces
- **lint-agent**: runs lint/format checks
- **release-agent**: prepares production artifacts

> Real agent configs live in the repoâ€™s package scripts and CI workflows.
